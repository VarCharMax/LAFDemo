## Analysis:
The sample code is an MVC controller as part of an administration screen for adding and updating agent data.

## Review:
The obvious weakness in the implementation is the database code embedded in the methods.

Business logic is implemented in the controller methods, meaning it would have to be re-implemented if required in other situations.

Also, the use of static variables and the client-side lock are clunky.

All dependent classes are defined in the same file.

From an architecture point of view, the controller is trying to do too many things, and lacks flexibility, because all the functionality is encapsulated in the one module. This can be improved by breaking it up into multiple tiers.

## Proposed solution:
Assuming we want to keep the controller, the data source should be provided by dependency injection, preferably via a service. Additionally, much of the controller logic can be implemented in the service. That way, the data and associated functionality can be consumed by other clients.

#### Specific steps:
- Create a data source. This could be a containerised database like MySQL, or, just for demonstration purposes, a singleton.
- Implement an ORM - presumably EntityFramework.
- Add functionality to populate the data source when the application is initialised.
- Create a service to inject data. This could be a REST service, or gRPC. Possibly there could be a chain of services.
- Place models in a separate project.
- Extract the business logic and move it either into the service, or a business logic layer that consumes the service.
- Try to replace the static variable with a memory-based solution such as Redis. This can also be implemented as a service, or possibly a middleware component that monitors the HTTP metadata and processes certain requests.
- Replace the lock with a database transaction.

#### Stretch goals:
- Containerise, or provide Dockerfile implementations as an option, wherever possible.
- Write one or two Unit Tests around the controller, mocking the service[s].
